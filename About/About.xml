(Please save your game FIRST. These operations unbalance vanilla pawns, and [spoiler]failed Trails of the Grasses[/spoiler] may kill your pawns.)

[h1]Update v2.0:[/h1]
v2.0 - [spoiler]C# implemented, Operations are sequential and require ingredients, white hair, witcher swords, and more.[/spoiler]


[h1]Introduction[/h1]	
This mod allows you to research the ancient Witcher trials and perform the procedures on your pawns. You are able to research:[list]
[*] The Trial of the Grasses: The first trial. The body is manipulated with herbs, toxins and poisons. This primarily affects the nervous system.
[*] The Trial of the Dreams: The second trial. The mutation of the eyes, hormones and bone marrow is performed.
[*] The Trial of the Elders: The final trial. Forgotton practices were once performed on the witchers. You too can uncover these secrets, and pay the price.[/list]


[h1]Good questions so far:[/h1][list]
[*]I have a big modlist, are there any compatability issues? - I sincerely doubt it, my mod only adds.
[*]Can I use this on a running savegame? - Knock yourself out, will be fine. Uninstalling is a different matter. 
[*]When I apply a new Trial, the old one disappears? - This is expected behaviour. Its easier to calculate the balance of the mod when only one Trial is being applied to the stats.
[/list]

[h1]Anticipated questions:[/h1][list]
[*]Q: My hair isnt white?! - 
	A: [spoiler]Keep going.[/spoiler]
[*]Q: These ingredients are unrealistic!/The research takes too long!/The costs are too damn high!
	A: [spoiler]Honestly? Witchers are overpowered, think of witchers as implanting every bionic. Now do you get it?[/spoiler]
[/list]

[h1]UNINSTALLING THIS MOD:[/h1][olist]
[*] Enable Dev Mode. (BUT I PERMANENTLY DISABLED IT!? - you've just learnt a valuable lesson.)
[*] Use 'Destroy' to delete any items made by my mod.
[*] Use 'Remove Hediff...' to disable the Trials bonuses on your affect pawns.
[*] Save your game, exit rimworld.[/olist]
Your save should now be clean.


Feedback encouraged.
